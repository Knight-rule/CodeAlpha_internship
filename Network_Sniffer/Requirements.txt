1. Scapy
Scapy is the core library you're using for packet sniffing and analysis

pip install scapy


2. Winpcap or Npcap (Windows only)
Since you're on Windows 11, Scapy needs a packet capture driver to sniff packets.
- Recommended: Npcap
- Download and install it.
- During installation, check:
- “Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible mode”
- “Support raw 802.11 traffic (and monitor mode)”
Without Npcap, Scapy won’t be able to sniff live packets.


3. Python Interpreter
Make sure Python is installed and added to your system PATH.

python --version

If not installed, grab it from python.org.
